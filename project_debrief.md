Black Thursday: Project Debrief
======
1. Identify 3 things went well. Why do you think these were successful?
  - Overall collaboration was smooth because we communicated well and were able to adapt to each others' needs.
  - The breaking down of the different parts of the project went well because we were able to work together to understand the different problem components.
  - Team dynamic was fun throughout the project which lessened the stress of tackling such a HUGE project.
2. Identify 3 things that didn't go well. Why do you think these were unsuccessful?
  - We don't feel like we had any strong interpersonal struggles, even though there may have been differences that might have been a problem in other teams, they were not for us due to reasons stated in question one. One example is that Drew feels more comfortable working at home and Ling prefers working at school, but we were able to make compromises.
3. Identify 2 things that were supposed to happen but didn't. What did happen instead? Why was there a difference between what you expected to happen and what did? (Our method was supposed to work but didn't is not a good answer. Look for things about your process or collaboration)
  - We did not always TDD effectively, sometimes writing code before the tests. This may have hampered our workflow in being able to move forward in the iterations.
  - We did not get to refactor everything we had planned due to scope of what refactoring would entail when compared to the deadline.
4. Identify 2 organizational constraints or we faced? How did we overcome them or did we?
 - We don't feel like we ran into any organizational constraints.
5. What existing techniques or approaches from past projects enhanced or enabled our performance on this project?
  - Splitting up the work where effective and possible.
  - Different ways of pairing.
6. Did the team meet sufficiently often and work productively together?
  - Yes.
7. Could time pressures have been alleviated by organizing the work differently?
  - We had good pace overall but chose to slow down a bit to alleviate some pressure. This compressed the last parts of the project a little bit. Had we not taken quite as much time off, we would not have had to cut back on the refactoring as stated above.
8. Could we have taken another approach to reach our goals more efficiently and effectively?
  - No.
9. Was the goal always clear?
  - Yes.
10. Were the instructions always clear?
  - No, particularly Iteration 4 - Most sold item by merchant - description was not clearly expressed and is not indicative of what the Spec Harness is expecting.  We ended up wasting quite a bit of time before someone explained what the spec harness actually wanted. [RAGE]
11. How can we do better next time?
  - Maybe we should have slowed down rather than completely taking a day off because that caused us to lose some momentum in our workflow.
